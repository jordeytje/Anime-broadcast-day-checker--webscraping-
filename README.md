# Anime broadcast day checker (webscraping)
 A tool that shows you which day all the currently airing anime will come out based on all the anime that youâ€™re currently watching

 How to use this magnificient tool:

 1. Install the dependencies (if this doesn't work, you only need Puppeteer)
 2. Go into index.js, on line 13 and change the name "spoochy" to your myanimelist profile name.
 3. run the script in your editor terminal by typing node index.js

 A table with the japanese/chinese name, english name and broadcast day and time will be shown in the terminal.
